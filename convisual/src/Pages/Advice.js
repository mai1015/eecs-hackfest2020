A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.  </p>

                    <p>Common signs of infection include <strong>respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties</strong>.

                    <p>As with other respiratory illnesses, infection with 2019-nCoV can cause mild symptoms including a <strong>runny nose</strong>, <strong>sore throat</strong>, <strong>cough</strong>, and <strong>fever</strong>.  It can be more severe for some persons and can lead to pneumonia or breathing difficulties.  More rarely, the disease can be fatal. Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as, <strong>diabetes</strong> and <strong>heart disease</strong>) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.</p>
